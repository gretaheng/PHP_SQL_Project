    We could build a topic model for those Weibo which has more positive comments than the negative comments.
    The analysis would show the trend of popular Weibo and help public relation agents deal with crisis or scandals
    and receive as many positive responses as possible. I would suggest build a topic model for Weibo with positive
    comments. We could further group those Weibo by the scandal type to track the words that are used most frequently.
    To achieve this functionality, I will need Scandal, Talks_about, Weibo, and Comments tables, and select Weibo which
    has c_type = ‘positive’(after join with Comments table).</font>

    Run a random forest model to find the features of celebrities who involved in scandals more than once.
    I would use information about celebrities in the Celebrities and Weibo_users tables as independent variables.
    Apart from that, I would also add an independent variable, which is the percent of past weibo that has more
    positive comments to show the celebrities influence on social media. Thus, three tables woule be used, Celebrities,
    Weibo_users, Comments, Scandals and Get_involved_in.</font>
